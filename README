There are my improved versions of Saving table to a file in Lua.
They're all based on the code snippet by _df_   http://www.forums.evilmana.com/lua-help/save-a-table-to-a-file/msg14319/#msg14319

There're 3 edits:
- Standard
- Full
- Extended

Main features:
* Saving strings, numbers, boolean(s) and tables, inside existing table (if there's a function or other data type - it won't be saved, there will appear just a message)
* FULL support of Lua syntax: tabs, {}, commas
* The save file can be loaded with dofile()
* Already optimized for writing to a file
* I try to keep it fast (although the Extended version is much slower than Full OR Standard)

Full version's improvements:
* No unnecessary @!#$ in your save file (see comparison!)

Extended version's improvements:
* Full version's features
plus:
* If a key is a string without special characters, it won't be inside ["..."]
* If a table has less than *your number here* then it won't be a multi-line table (see comparison)
